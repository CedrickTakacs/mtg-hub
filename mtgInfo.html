  <h1>Magic: The Gathering Beginner's Guide</h1>
  
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Magic: The Gathering (MTG) is a collectible card game created by mathematician Richard Garfield and published by Wizards of the Coast. In MTG, players take on the roles of powerful wizards known as Planeswalkers and engage in a strategic battle by casting spells, summoning creatures, and using various other magical effects to defeat their opponents.</p>
  
  <h2>Basic Gameplay</h2>
  <p>MTG is typically played between two players, each with their own deck of cards. The goal is to reduce the opponent's starting life total from 20 to 0, using a combination of creature attacks, spellcasting, and other game mechanics.</p>
  <p>A player's deck consists of a variety of cards, including lands, creatures, spells, and enchantments. Each player starts the game with a hand of seven cards, and players take turns playing cards and resolving their effects.</p>
  
  <h2>Card Types</h2>
  <p>MTG features different types of cards:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Lands:</strong> Lands provide the magical energy, or mana, needed to cast spells. They are essential for playing other cards.</li>
    <li><strong>Creatures:</strong> Creatures are powerful beings that can attack opponents, block attacks, and have various abilities.</li>
    <li><strong>Spells:</strong> Spells are non-creature cards that can have various effects, such as damaging opponents, destroying creatures, or providing other advantages.</li>
    <li><strong>Enchantments:</strong> Enchantments are permanent cards that give ongoing effects to players, creatures, or the game itself.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Mana and Casting Spells</h2>
  <p>Each card in MTG has a mana cost, which represents the type and amount of mana required to cast the spell. Mana is generated by tapping (turning sideways) lands. Different lands produce different colors of mana, and some spells require specific colors of mana to cast.</p>
  
  <h2>Turn Structure</h2>
  <p>A typical turn in MTG consists of the following phases:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Untap:</strong> Untap all cards that were tapped on the previous turn.</li>
    <li><strong>Upkeep:</strong> Some cards may have effects that occur during this phase.</li>
    <li><strong>Draw:</strong> Draw one card from your deck.</li>
    <li><strong>Main Phase:</strong> Play land cards and cast spells.</li>
    <li><strong>Combat Phase:</strong> Declare attackers and defenders, resolve combat damage.</li>
    <li><strong>Main Phase 2:</strong> Play more spells and use abilities.</li>
    <li><strong>End Step:</strong> Some cards may have effects that occur at the end of the turn.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <h2>Winning the Game</h2>
  <p>The game ends when one player's life total is reduced to 0 or if a special condition specified by a card or game rule is met.</p>
